            <h3>Whats is the Halloween</h3>
        <p>
          Halloween is a holiday celebrated each year on October 31, and
          Halloween 2022 will occur on Monday, October 31. The tradition
          originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, when people
          would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. In the
          eighth century, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as a time to
          honor all saints. Soon, All Saints Day incorporated some of the
          traditions of Samhain. The evening before was known as All Hallows
          Eve, and later Halloween. Over time, Halloween evolved into a day of
          activities like trick-or-treating, carving jack-o-lanterns, festive
          gatherings, donning costumes and eating treats.

            <h3>Ancient Origins of Halloween</h3>
            <p>
            Halloweenâ€™s origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of
            Samhain (pronounced sow-in). The Celts, who lived 2,000 years ago,
            mostly in the area that is now Ireland, the United Kingdom and
            northern France, celebrated their new year on November 1. This day
            marked the end of summer and the harvest and the beginning of the
            dark, cold winter, a time of year that was often associated with human
            death. Celts believed that on the night before the new year, the
            boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead became blurred.
            On the night of October 31 they celebrated Samhain, when it was
            believed that the ghosts of the dead returned to earth.
